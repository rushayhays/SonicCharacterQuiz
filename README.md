# So you want your own Sonic Character Quiz?

### This quiz can actually be used as a template for any simple "Which Character are You" quiz

Currently there are two types of questions, character questions and alignment questions.
Character questions have one answer for each character.
Alignment questions are a broader category and have the characters split between, "good guys", "bad guys", and "anti-heros"

## Notes for Future Development
In the future it would be great for alignment questions to determine which character questions you get asked.
Right now all the questions are loaded at once, but ideally, an alignment question would be asked and then three character questions for characters of that alignment would then load. This would be followed by another alignment question, and so on.

Currently all the questions are hard-coded into the QuizQuestionaire file. It would be great to break them out into seperate files to facilitate a quiz that asks you different questions based on the answers you give it.
